      <p>Hello, my name is Christian and this is my portfolio.</p>

        I enjoy working on new projects and learning as much as I can. My latest 
        project is working on this very portfolio, using Java applets and 
        various Google cloud services to host and build the site. My free time is
        usually spent around video games, playing them, reading about various 
        industry and behind-the-scenes "stuff", or thinking about how the design 
        of their mechanisms and overall gameplay fit, or don't fit, together. I 
        also like to listen to a bunch of tech and science podcasts.
