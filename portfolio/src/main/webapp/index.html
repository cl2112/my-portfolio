            <h3>Hello, my name is Christian Liguori.</h3>
            <p>
              I enjoy working on new projects and learning as much as I can. My 
              latest project is working on this very portfolio, using Java 
              applets and various Google cloud services to host and build the 
              site. My free time is usually spent around video games, playing 
              them, reading about various industry and behind-the-scenes 
              "stuff", or thinking about how the design of their mechanisms and 
              overall gameplay fits, or doesn't fit, together. I also like to 
              listen to a bunch of tech and science podcasts.

                    This is the final project I made for my python class at Kean
                    University. The goal was to create an app that aggregated all
                    of the important information from local governments so that
                    it was easy for people to get involved. I started by 
                    scraping the local government websites and displaying it in
                    a GUI. While working on the project I found out that the 
                    information I was expecting to find was not available or 
                    was hard to find and parse. If I were to do it over again, I
                    would focus on creating a guide that explained more about how
                    local governments work so that the work would reach more 
                    people. Still, I am happy with the progress I made and 
                    learning about front end with python, local governments and
                    web scraping.

                    This is one of the earlier projects I completed in the 
                    web development bootcamp I took at Rutgers University. I 
                    have always been a fan of fighting games and I thought that
                    it would make a great theme for a hangman game. I spent a lot
                    of time on this project and it was an early marker for me and
                    my path toward a career in computer science.
